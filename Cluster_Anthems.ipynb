    "# Text Clustering with K-Means\n",
    "In the present notebook we will use the [k-means algorithm](https://www.datascience.com/blog/k-means-clustering), a simple and popular __*unsupervised clustering*__ algorithm, to cluster the national anthems of the world into different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed defined number (k) of centroids in a dataset. A centroid refers to a cluster, which is a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities with each other. The ‘means’ in the K-means refers to the averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid. And the algorithm is said to be unsupervised because we have no prior knowledge with regards to the groups or classes of our dataset, that is, we will find the underlying groups in our dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we can visualize the algorithm. The green centroids matches the closest datapoints to each one and form clusters, then each centroid moves to the center of each respective group and matches again the closest datapoint to each other."
